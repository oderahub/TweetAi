Overview
This Node.js application is built using Express, with a focus on handling background tasks using a Bull queue system. The application performs operations like creating "Autobots" 
and their related entities (posts and comments) as background jobs. The application is designed to scale and handle tasks asynchronously, leveraging WebSocket for real-time updates.

Key Components
Express Server Setup:

The server is created using express and http.
Socket.IO is used to handle WebSocket connections for real-time communication with clients.
Middlewares like rateLimiter, cors, and swaggerDocs are applied to the app for security, cross-origin requests, and API documentation respectively.
WebSocket Integration:

The server uses Socket.IO to establish WebSocket connections, allowing real-time updates to clients, such as emitting the current count of Autobots.
Every time a client connects, the server emits the current Autobot count and continues to send periodic updates every 500 seconds.
Bull Queue Setup:

Bull is a Redis-based queue system used to manage background jobs.
The autobotQueue is configured to add jobs related to creating Autobots. The jobs are processed in the background, allowing the server to handle other requests without being blocked.
Scheduled Background Jobs with Cron:

A cron job is scheduled to automatically add a new job to the autobotQueue every hour (cron.schedule('0 * * * *', ...)).
This ensures that the process of creating Autobots and their related entities is carried out regularly without manual intervention.
Database Connection:

The application connects to a database using AppDataSource.initialize(). Once connected, the server starts listening for incoming requests.
Job Processing:

The jobs added to the autobotQueue are processed by a job processor defined in ./jobs.
This processor utilizes the AutobotService to create Autobots, posts, and comments in bulk, ensuring efficient handling of these tasks.
Monitoring Job Status:

The application listens for job completion and failure events on the autobotQueue.
It logs messages for successful job completions and errors for any failures, helping in monitoring the health of the background processes.
Conclusion
Without the manual trigger endpoint, your application relies entirely on the cron job to schedule the creation of Autobots, ensuring that the background process is automated and runs consistently every hour. This setup is robust, scalable, and ideal for handling recurring tasks without user intervention.
